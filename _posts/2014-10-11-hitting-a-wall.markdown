title: Hitting a wall

The first couple of hours in navigating my jekyll blog and I have already hit a wall.

From what guides and online tutorials I've read so far, most if not all state to not touch the _site folder, but I am unsure on where to even make the slightest CSS changes to customize my blog. Most advice points to the "easy and helpful" Jekyll documentation, but reading some of the tips leave me more confuzzled than before.

Cue frustration, and more dabbling. To be continued....
