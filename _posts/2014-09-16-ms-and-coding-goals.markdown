title: MS and Coding Goals
date: 2014-09-16

Here are some of my goals that I have set for myself during my time at MakerSquare and as a web-savy human being.

* Create a dynamic website using HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery
* Understand the theory behind markup languages and dynamic computer programming languages such as Javascript
* Start creating a portfolio
* Actively practice what I learn in class and outside of class.

In continuation from my post in the previous week, I have only the inch-above-surface-level understanding and practice of what goes in building a static and/or dynamic website. Coding always piqued my interest, but life threw distractions and my interest always took a seat in the backburner...until now.

I'm excited, a little overwhelmed, and optimistic. I also invested in purchasing my very first Mac. (My previous computer met an untimely end two months before classes started.)

One of the first things that I started to learn how to navigate is the Terminal. At first, it looks frightening: a black screen of death with blinking neon green font like in The Matrix. Many of my reactions is to freeze in fear when I type an incorrect command...or to find that I created a git repo in the incorrect place. However, as I've come to quickly find, one is usually going to get it wrong on the first try when learning this kind of discipline. 

And so, more coding shenanigans to come.
