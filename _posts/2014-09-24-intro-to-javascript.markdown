title: Intro to Javascript

This week and the past week involved the first toe in the pool of what is Javascript.

First thing is: Javascript does not stand alone. HTML provides the structure to a web page, CSS gives it presentation, and Javascript gives it the interactive flair. In a nutshell, one would have to be well-versed in the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

In addition, one of the libraries that we use with Javascript is JQuery. JQuery contains cool and useful plugins to make a site more interactive with the user.

JS information can be placed between the HTML <em>head</em> tags, or in just before the closing <em>body</em> tag.

It's all a brief taste of what JS can do, but hopefully I will be able to learn and implement it into my own future projects.
